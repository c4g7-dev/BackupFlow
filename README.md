# ðŸ’¾ BackupFlow

Cloudâ€‘native, incremental-ready backup system for Minecraft Paper/Purpur 1.21+. Push compressed world + plugin snapshots directly to S3/MinIO (or any S3-compatible storage). Designed for multi-server fleets, containerized deployments, and hands-off reliability.

Now includes: selective section restore, async restore & verify, integrity hash manifest (SHAâ€‘256), retention planning preview.

## What is it?
BackupFlow centralizes automated world + config + plugin backups in object storage. Each server pushes into a shared logical namespace using a unique `serverId`. Future versions will support chunk/incremental diffing.

## Why use BackupFlow?
- One standard workflow across all servers
- Object storage durability + versioning
- Fast, compressed ZIP output
- Works great with container or ephemeral nodes
- Simple restore path using manifest JSON
- Low overhead: build â†’ compress â†’ upload â†’ clean

---
## Features
- Worlds + Nether + End + optional extra paths
- Optional plugin + config inclusion
- Wildcard include: use `*` to auto-detect all worlds (folders with level.dat) and implicitly include plugins + configs when explicit lists are omitted
- ZIP compression (tar.gz planned)
- Randomized jitter scheduling to avoid cluster spikes
- Integrity hash manifest (SHA-256 per file) optional
- Selective section restore & verify (`--select worlds,plugins,configs,extra`)
- Async restore & verify (non-blocking main thread)
- Retention plan preview (`/backupflow retention plan`)
- Manifests stored alongside backups (JSON)
- S3/MinIO layout under configurable `rootDir`
- Multi-server isolation via `serverId`
- Manual + scheduled backups
- Listing of backups + manifests

Planned / Roadmap:
- Incremental/chunk-based deduplication (content addressing)
- Automatic lifecycle pruning (client + bucket policy synergy)
- Tar.gz option
- Active prune executor using retention rules
- Partial differential world chunk mode

---
## Storage Layout
```
FlowStack/BackupFlow/
  backups/<serverId>/full/<epochMillis>/full-<epoch>.zip
  manifests/<serverId>-<epoch>-<rand>.json
```

Example manifest (simplified):
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1737574755000,
  "serverId": "lobby",
  "reason": "scheduled",
  "files": ["full-1737574755000.zip"]
}
```

---
## Installation
1. Drop `BackupFlow-<version>-all.jar` into `plugins/`
2. Start server to generate `config.yml`
3. Configure S3 credentials + bucket
4. (Optional) Set `BACKUPFLOW_SERVER_ID` env var per instance
5. Reload or restart

---
## Quick Start Commands
```
/backupflow help                       # list commands
/backupflow backup                     # run a full backup now
/backupflow list                       # list backup timestamps (epoch millis)
/backupflow manifests                  # list manifest objects
/backupflow restore <ts> [--select ...] [--force]  # async selective restore
/backupflow verify <ts> [--select ...]             # async integrity verify (if hashes present)
/backupflow retention plan [--keepDays N] [--max N]# preview retention effects
/backupflow version                    # show plugin version
```

## Configuration (config.yml excerpt)
```yaml
s3:
  endpoint: "play.minio.local:9000"
  secure: true
  accessKey: "ACCESS_KEY"
  secretKey: "SECRET_KEY"
  bucket: "backups"
  rootDir: "FlowStack/BackupFlow"

backup:
  include:
    # Use ["*"] to auto-detect worlds (any directory containing level.dat)
    # If worlds + extraPaths empty and plugins/configs keys omitted => implicit '*'
    worlds: ["world", "world_nether", "world_the_end"]  # or ["*"]
    plugins: true   # omit when using '*' for auto include
    configs: true   # omit when using '*' for auto include
    extraPaths: []  # '*' ignored here; enumerate explicit extra paths
  compression: zip
  retention:
    enableLifecycle: false
    maxLocalEntries: 10
  schedule:
    enabled: true
    intervalMinutes: 60
    jitterSeconds: 30

restore:
  allowDirectDownload: true
  tempDir: "plugins/BackupFlow/work/tmp"   # shared temp workspace (download/extract)
  restoreDir: "restores"                   # (future) staging area for advanced flows

manifest:
  storeInBucket: true
  prefix: "manifests"

integrity:
  hashes: true   # embed per-file SHA-256 hash map inside manifest when true
```
